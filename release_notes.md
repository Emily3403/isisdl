# Changes

### Bundled all functionality into one executable

Previously there were different executables for different actions. This model of bundling actions conflicts with a
static
build of isisdl, since you would have to build every executable separately.

### Added external links

Now the entire course page is searched for anything that matches an url (regex based). If one is found, it gets queried
and
if the `Content-Type` is `application/*`, the page is downloaded.

This means that any url mentioned in ISIS, will now appear as part of the course. Since a web-request has to be sent for
every external url, it takes quite a lot of time. The downloaded information is of course cached, so it does not have to
be retrieved every time.

Note that the TU Berlin is liable for content posted on ISIS, but not for external links. So if you do not want this
risk,
you might want to consider disabling this option.

### More configuration options

Now added the following options:

- Renaming courses
- Following external links
- Should subdirectories be created in the main course directory?
- Should file names be displayed as absolute paths?

### If you open a not downloaded file, it will get downloaded with priority

This is made possible by the Linux Kernel API inotify. Whenever any program opens any file in the `~/isisdl` directory,
the streaming thread will get notified. It pauses all other downloads and downloads the opened file with maximum
bandwidth.

This is especially useful, if you either don't want to download all video files, but still be able to view them
with `vlc`, or if you want to start watching videos while the download is still running.

Specifically for the former use case I added an option `--stream`, which will launch only the streaming
thread.

### Subscribe to *all* courses

**Currently unsupported due to legal reasons**

In order for me to limit test `isisdl`, I want to have access to as many courses as possible. Because of that I decided
to implement a way of subscribing to all publicly available courses.

It is done by trying to subscribe to every course with the API. If it was successful, the result is stored in the
database. With this it is also possible to unsubscribe from all courses automatically. Unfortunately this is quite slow
since unsubscribing via the Moodle API is not supportedâ€¦ ([yet](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-64255)).



## Minor changes

Better progress bar. Split phases in two so the status is actually accurate.

Changed the master password to a sha digest of a string. It now has 64 characters.

Before launching it is checked if you have an active internet connection. If not, `isisdl` is exited gracefully.

`isisdl` will now only ever prompt you 1x for your password.

Fixed a bug where, if you throttle too high (2MiB/s), nothing would get downloaded.

A few bug fixes here and there. Probably also introduced some more bugs :D
