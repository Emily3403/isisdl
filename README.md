## Installation

You **will** need a working python3.8 interpreter or above. The script will fail for python3.7 as some new python3.8
features are used.

If you are familiar with `pip` and have it set up, simply install it with

```shell
pip install isisdl
```

To run the executable type
```shell
isisdl
```
into your favorite shell.

For more detailed instructions on installing (including the manual installation) please consult the wiki pages.

Consider checking out the [gitlab](https://git.tu-berlin.de/freddy1404/isia-tub)

This was the original inspiration for this library. At the time isia did not offer the functionality of uri-encoding the
password which lead me to create this library. I have recently implemented this functionality into isia in order to
benchmark and test both solutions.
