# Changelog version 1.3.13

- This changelog
  - Now you will get notified about all new features through this text.
  - This should be more convenient than tracking down individual release notes or going through commit messages

- Fixed (Apple) ARM bug with isisdl
  - When executing isisdl on a ARM machine the following error would arise
  > `UnicodeError: encoding with 'idna' codec failed (UnicodeError: label too long)`
  - This bug has now been resolved by bypassing all proxies.

- Changed the storage place of documents to be strictly in the root of the course.
  - Previously some documents that originate from `isis.tu-berlin.de` were placed in the `Extern/` directory.
  - The origin is now tracked and the files are placed in their respective directories accordingly.

- More Content
  - Due to a bug in the conflict-checker, some videos were not downloaded. This behaviour is now fixed.

- Download diff
  - There is now a new subprogram to compare the downloaded files of an arbitrary directory and compare the differences to the `isisdl` directory.
  - This program is especially useful when comparing different ISIS / Moodle-downloaders and checking if isisdl grabs all the content.

(I realize that this changelog is probably not going to be read as the previous version of isisdl did not include a mechanism to view the changelog)
