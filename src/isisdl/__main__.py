#   Change Database â†’ Version 1.4
#       Make the size attribute not mandatory for a file
#           â†’ Logger looses the ability to report total number of bytes available
#           â†’ MediaContainer can't be compared with __gt__ â†’ TODO: what does this cause? â†’ Tests start failing in chop_down_size
#           â†’ Loose the ability to _always_ check if a file exists â†’ if a file does not have a size, it is not downloaded
#           â†’ checking for conflict will be _way_ harder â†’ TODO: How to solve? Videos at least have a video length size â†’ Maybe use that?
#           â†’ DownloadStatus won't have an ETA
#           â†’ Syncing the Database will be of lower quality: Ignore all Documents and only restore the videos: Their name / url is the SHA-Sum of their content.
#
#       is_corrupted attribute change
#           â†’ Note the last time checked and retry the url based on an exponential backoff strategy
#
#       Remove the path attribute
#           â†’ Make the path of a file entirely dynamic and dependant on the configured state.
#             This should lead to a seamless migration of the directory when changing it's name.
#             This also enables easy renaming of courses and deselecting of the subdir option, assuming the directories have been moved accordingly.
#
#       No more json strings
#           â†’ Extra table for user configuration
#
#       Make storing your password more secure
#           â†’ Achieved by generating a random master password + random salt and store it in the database.
#             This enables for greater security since 1 table is all that is needed in order to crack multiple passwords
#
#       Verify the database state on every startup by iterating over all files + sizes and raising an error if the size and checksum don't match
#
#       These changes imply the following
#           â†’ Don't check any URL's that are not extern
#           â†’

# TODO:
#
#   Check how many urls requested multiple times
#
#   Calculate the number of threads to use dynamically
#
#   Check what isisdl is doing after building request cache â†’ why is it so slow in valgrind?
#
#   Argcomplete
#       https://pypi.org/project/argcomplete/
#       qmk can also do this
#   â†’ Seems kinda hard / shitty to use
#
#   Compare program to check diffs against isia-tub
#       â†’ More content
#
#   Throttling does not work when imposed via config ??
#
#   When exiting show exact done in.
#
#   When no new discovered files then don't show None but instead don't print anything at all.
#
#   Better course targeting mechanism by first downloading those where you have participated
#
#   Fix bug when first starting then it looks like stream


# Maybe TODO
#
#   fixing / bug hunting the compress
#
#   Have a variable for posix and linux
#
#   Static builds from github runners
#
#   Wiki tutorial for streaming
