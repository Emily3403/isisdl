# Changelog version 1.3.15

- Download of all assignments
  - There existed a bug since isisdl version 1.3.7 which lead to all the assignments not being downloaded anymore.

- Improved downloading algorithm: If you only have limited bandwidth available, the number of downloading threads will
  be dynamically rescaled to fit your needs.

  E.g. if you have a 10 MiB/s connection, one video-downloading thread will suffice while you still want your documents
  to be downloaded with 6 threads. This problem is addressed with this fix.

- Added hostname to the status page, so you know where the files are downloaded from.
